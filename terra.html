            <h1>Terra <small>(2015)</small></h1>
            <p>
                Terra is a shoot 'em up game developed by myself and two other Brown students, Hassan Sufi and Ujwal Ranganeni. The java-based engine was originally built by me, with features like parallax (made by Ujwal) and persistence/saving capabilities (made by Hassan) added on for this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Asset creation was split between myself and Ujwal. I was responsible for creating the backgrounds, terrain textures, enemies, HUD, and enemy sprites. Ujwal worked on the player sprite, weapon designs, and the background trees (in the middle parallax layer during gameplay). The gameplay focuses on survivng 30 nights on an alien plant, ensuring that both the player an the base station are protected. Aiming with the mouse, platforming with WASD, and item placement (tower defense-style) all play a role in ensuring survival.

            <div>
                <h2>Nightime Survival</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the area the player spends the most time in. In order to survive a night, the player must survive until dawn before aliens destroy the base station. Terrain and enemy placement are both procedually generated, changing each night. As the game progresses, enemies get tougher and spawn in greater numbers. Some aliens also become faster and more powerful.

                <h2>Upgrades</h2>
                <p>
                    After surviving a night, the player gets to go back inside the base to equip upgrades. Stat increases (e.g. higher strength/speed/knockback), turrets, and new weapons are all buyable using XP. 1 XP point is given to the player at the end of each night. Although stats are refundable, turrets and weapons are bought permanently and cannot be returned.

                <h2>Placing Defences</h2>
                <p>
                    If the player has bought any turrets, they can be placed down before the start of each night. Since turrets have a limited range, it's important to strategize and place them in useful locations. Depeding on the terrain hilliness, each turret type will vary in usefulness. Turrets are also affected by player stats, and each turret type takes advantage of different stats. Try experimenting with different turret/stat combinations!

                <h3>Runner</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Runners will charge in towards the player, dealing damage gradually when in contact with either the player or the base. Due to their constant running, Runners are the fastest enemy in the game, making them the most devastating enemy during the last few nights.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Spiders move in small bursts, scurrying towards the base. Their small size and inconsistent speed can make them difficult to hit. Although a single spider doesn't pose much of a threat, a large group can become a distraction that protects the more powerful Runners.</p>

                <p>Like the name, these enemies will fly over the player's head, launching bullets at the base. Although the flyers themselves don't deal any damage to the base, the bullets do. As the game progresses, Flyers increase in number and launch more bullets.</p>

                <p>Bullets are the projectiles launched by Flyers. They descend slowly while moving towards the base, exploding on contact with any surface. Although not very dangerous at first, these projectiles become faster, stronger, and more common as the nights go by.</p>
