      <h2 class="mt0">Terra</h2>

      <p>
        Terra is a shoot 'em up survival game developed by myself and two other Brown students, Hassan Sufi and Ujwal Ranganeni. The java-based engine was originally built by me, with features like parallax (made by Ujwal) and persistence/saving capabilities (made by Hassan) added on for this project.

      <h2>3DARIO</h2>

      <p>
        This game was built for CS132: Modern Web Applications with Brown students Sam Johnson and Ryan Kalla. It plays like <a class="post__link post__link--inverse" href="http://agar.io/">Agario</a> except that players instead move in three dimensions. My portion of the project focused on player movement and UI design.

      <h2>Bash Bros</h2>

      <p>
        This fighting game was developed by four Brown students: Christian Giancarlo, Luke Priebe, Preston Law, and myself. Since players don't have control over the character's movement, much of the strategy is about character customization and input timing.
