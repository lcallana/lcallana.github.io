			<p>All of these logos were made for fun for Rocket League players and groups.</p>

			<h2 class="mt0">Mariano Arruda</h2>

			<p>
				This logo was designed for (and is currently used by) professional Rocket League player <a target="_blank"
					href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1JPEwMqLaI96qRUKNp3_ow">Mariano Arruda.</a> The design incorporates
				portions of his username, SquishyMuffinz.
			</p>

			<p>
				The initial goal was to make a muffin-colored S and M. The darker color for the M was to make it feel more like
				the wrapper for the whole muffin shape, while the S was a light brown representing the muffin top.
			</p>

			<div class="grid-2">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v1.png" alt="v1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v2.png" alt="v2">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v3.png" alt="v3">
			</div>

			<p>
				The next step involved reworking the color and S-shape. The color was switched to a gradient blue to match the
				gaming organization Mariano plays for, <a href="http://cloud9.gg/">Cloud9</a>. As for the S-shape, it not only
				looked too much like a mushroom, but also the lack of white space made the letterform less readable. Because of
				this, the S's curves were increased and the shape was made to look more lumpy like a muffin.
			</p>

			<div class="grid-1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v4.png" alt="v4">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v5.png" alt="v5">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v6.png" alt="v6">
				<img src="./img/logos/Squishy_v7.png" alt="v7">
			</div>

			<p>
				The final step was to improve the left-right balance of the logo, which I did by resizing/repositioning the logo
				and increasing the length of the top of the S.
			</p>

			</div>

			<h2>Aviato</h2>

			<p>
				<a target="_blank" href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AviatoGaming">Aviato</a>, a group of Rocket League
				players (not the Silicon Valley program), currently uses this logo. From the start, the logo was to include some
				form of flight to emphasize the "aviation" aspect of the group's name while also maintaining a sporty look
				(since Rocket League is an eSport). All the artboards that led to the final result can be seen below. This
				design required a lot of potential designs since there are many ways to interpret the concept of flight.
			</p>

			<img src="./img/logos/Aviato_0.png" alt="first drafts">

			<p>Here are the final 3 versions of the logo. A purple-blue gradient with angled zig-zag shapes was chosen to
				represent hills and an early morning sky.</p>

			<div class="grid-1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Aviato_1.png" alt="v1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Aviato_2.png" alt="v2">
				<img src="./img/logos/Aviato_3.png" alt="v3">
			</div>

			<h2>Cameron Bills</h2>

			<p>
				This was a logo concept for professional player Cameron Bills, also known as Kronovi. His symbol is a mountain,
				so my first drafts looked at ways to combine Cameron's username, Kronovi, with a simple mountain range shape.
			</p>

			<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi0.png" alt="kronovi first drafts">

			<p>
				Since all of the drafts above seemed overly complex and unbalanced, I shifted towards a monogram to keep the
				design simple. The mountain in the K's white space, combined with a cool and bright gradient, made the design
				readable as a mountain range under a "K" rather than an odd-looking "V" shape.
			</p>

			<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi0_2.png" alt="kronovi second drafts">

			<p>Here are the final versions. Both blue and purple worked well, where purple compromised some of the sky-like
				aspect of the K for increased color contrast.</p>

			<div class="grid-1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi1.png" alt="v1">
				<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi3.png" alt="v3">
				<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi4.png" alt="v4">
				<img src="./img/logos/Kronovi5.png" alt="v5">
			</div>

			<h2>Kyle Robertson</h2>

			<p>
				This design was for professional Rocket League player Kyle Robertson, a.k.a. Scrub Killa. The initial design was
				meant to be sharp and edgy to match the "killa" part of Kyle's username. The version encompassed by a circle
				included a scythe shape to further the connection.
			</p>

			<img src="./img/logos/scrubkilla0.png" alt="scrubkilla first draft">

			<p>
				Unfortunately, none of the designs above seemed readable at a distance, and I didn't feel like my designs were
				improving. At this point, I decided a new approach was needed, so I began sketching my ideas on paper instead.
			</p>

			<img src="./img/logos/scrubkilla0_2.jpg" alt="scrubkilla sketches">

			<p>The one outlined by a square seemed the most readable and balanced, so I converted it into a vectorized logo.
				This final design incorporates an S and K monogram with deep red blood-splatter shapes to maintain the "killer"
				theming. Below are the two final versions, the first being inverted for dark/colored backgrounds.</p>

			<h2>Vinto</h2>

			<p>
				This is a logo design for a friend who plays professionally for <a target="_blank"
					href="http://3p-esports.com/">Triple Play eSports</a>. The initial design was part of an experiment with
				golden-ratio based logos: the initial shape was made with 3 squared, the largest (middle) one being about 1.618
				times larger than the other two. The design was then shifted from a blue/purple to a gray with a green play icon
				to match the Triple Play eSports theme.
			</p>

				<img src="./img/logos/vinto_1.png" alt="v1">

				<img src="./img/logos/Vinto_4.png" alt="v4">
				<img src="./img/logos/Vinto_5.png" alt="v5">
			</div>

			<h2>Plex</h2>

			<p>
				This was one of my earlier logo designs for another friend who plays Rocket League, Plex. Since Rocket League is
				an eSport where a ball is launched around in a stadium, the design incorporates a ball (the smaller circle) and
				motion lines (which also act as the "E" in Plex). The circle design reminded me of Mastercard's logo, and this
				influenced the final color choice and the design with the large solid circle.
