        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a sophomore at Brown University who's interested in both computer science and graphic design. Beginning with Visual Basic in high school, I quickly became fascinated with writing programs that produced graphics. I picked up HTML, CSS and JavaScript, creating my first website back in 2013. This also led me to working on a web application with the company Riperian. In addion to web languages, I've also been learning Java since high school. In Software Engineering and 2D Game Engines classes at Brown, I got to work with a Java-based game engine and then make my own. Other interests include Chinese, Karate (Okinawan Goju-ryu), making music, and video editing.</p>

        <h1>Terra <small>(2015)</small></h1>
        <p>
            Terra is a shoot 'em up game developed by myself and two other Brown students, Hassan Sufi and Ujwal Ranganeni. The java-based engine was originally built by me, with features like parallax (made by Ujwal) and persistence/saving capabilities (made by Hassan) added on for this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asset creation was split between myself and Ujwal. I was responsible for creating the backgrounds, terrain textures, enemies, HUD, and enemy sprites. Ujwal worked on the player sprite, weapon designs, and the background trees (in the middle parallax layer during gameplay). The gameplay focuses on survivng 30 nights on an alien plant, ensuring that both the player an the base station are protected. Aiming with the mouse, platforming with WASD, and item placement (tower defense-style) all play a role in ensuring survival.
        </p>

        <h2>Nightime Survival</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>
            <source src="./assets/video/terra/night.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            This is the area the player spends the most time in. In order to survive a night, the player must survive until dawn before aliens destroy the base station. Terrain and enemy placement are both procedually generated, changing each night. As the game progresses, enemies get tougher and spawn in greater numbers. Some aliens also become faster and more powerful.
        </p>

        <h2>Upgrades</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>

        </video>
        <p>
            After surviving a night, the player gets to go back inside the base to equip upgrades. Stat increases (e.g. higher strength/speed/knockback), turrets, and new weapons are all buyable using XP. 1 XP point is given to the player at the end of each night. Although stats are refundable, turrets and weapons are bought permanently and cannot be returned.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Placing Defences</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>
            <source src="./assets/video/terra/turret.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            If the player has bought any turrets, they can be placed down before the start of each night. Since turrets have a limited range, it's important to strategize and place them in useful locations. Depeding on the terrain hilliness, each turret type will vary in usefulness. Turrets are also affected by player stats, and each turret type takes advantage of different stats. Try experimenting with different turret/stat combinations!

        <h2>Enemy Types</h2>
        <img src="./assets/image/terra/bomber.gif">
        <h3>Runner</h3>
        <p>Runners will charge in towards the player, dealing damage gradually when in contact with either the player or the base. Due to their constant running, Runners are the fastest enemy in the game, making them the most devastating enemy during the last few nights.</p>

        <hr>
        <img src="./assets/image/terra/spider.gif" style="margin-top: -48px;">
        <h3>Spider</h3>
        <p>Spiders move in small bursts, scurrying towards the base. Their small size and inconsistent speed can make them difficult to hit. Although a single spider doesn't pose much of a threat, a large group can become a distraction that protects the more powerful Runners.</p>

        <hr>

        <img src="./assets/image/terra/flyer.gif">
        <h3>Flyer</h3>
        <p>Like the name, these enemies will fly over the player's head, launching bullets at the base. Although the flyers themselves don't deal any damage to the base, the bullets do. As the game progresses, Flyers increase in number and launch more bullets.</p>

        <hr>

        <img src="./assets/image/terra/bullet.gif">
        <h3>Bullet</h3>
        <p>Bullets are the projectiles launched by Flyers. They descend slowly while moving towards the base, exploding on contact with any surface. Although not very dangerous at first, these projectiles become faster, stronger, and more common as the nights go by.</p>

        <h1>Bash Bros <small>(2015)</small></h1>
        <p>
            Bash Bros is a fighting game all about using a customized team of 3 characters to bash the opposing team off the central platform. Since players don't have control over the character's movement, much of the strategy is about character building and timing. If you want to get an idea of how it works, take a look at the me playing the AI below (I'm the red team).
        </p>
        <p>
            The project was developed by four Brown University students: Christian Giancarlo, Luke Priebe, Preston Law, and myself. The visual assets were my main contribution to this project. I was responsible for creating the character walking/attack/defend animations, menu buttons/window appearance, all of the backgrounds, and the title screen logo. Other than the alternate skins for characters, the assets were made by me. I also helped program and structure characters and their classes in Java.

        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>
            <source src="./assets/video/BashBros_CharAttack.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            The controls are simple: the key shown above each character is that character's attack button. The shaded area that shrinks over time (in the white box with the "S") represents the cooldown time for the character's attack. Once it's all the way down, the character will be ready to attack again.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Character Building</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>
            <source src="./assets/video/BashBros_CharBuilder.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            There are 3 stats that can be directly modified: attack (knockback power), defence (resistance to knockback) and speed (walking speed). As each of these are increased, the cooldown time for the attack will increase, meaning that the character has to wait longer before attacking again. Finding a good balance depends on the character's class and its team members in game.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Making a team</h2>
        <video loop muted controls>
            <source src="./assets/video/BashBros_CharTeam.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p>
            A team consists of 3 characters of your choosing. Alhough a lot of time can be put into crafting individual characters, it is equally important to think about how they work on a team. For example, a team of three extremely strong characters might not succeed because of how long they must wait between attacks. Also, team consisting of one class could be rendered useless by a team which can exploit that class's weakness.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Character Classes</h2>
        <img src="./assets/image/bashbros/char_sprite_knight.gif">
        <h3>Knight</h3>
        <p>A knight's best weapon is the sword: it cuts through projectiles from opponent mages, and it can hit multiple opponents if they are close enough. Knights can serve as defensive walls: they are more difficult to knock back because of their heavy armor. This gives them the upper hand when it comes to surviving an attack, but it also ends up weighing them down a bit. This makes them the slowest of the three classes..</p>

        <h3>Mage</h3>
        <p>Mages use their powerful magic to attack their opponents from a distance. The projectiles they fire have a bit more power than ordinary weapons, making Mages the most powerful of the classes in terms of attack. There are some downsides, however: the magic can be blocked by an opponent's attack, and the robes they wear aren't enough to keep them safe from attacks, making them prone to attacks.</p>

        <h3>Rogue</h3>
        <p>Rogues can't attack opponents directly, rendering them useless when alone. Rogues are, however, known to bee speedy and stealthy, making them the fastest of the three classes. They pefer using traps, which can quickly be tossed down to be activated later. These traps pierce the defences of an opponent, lowering their defences and, consequentially, making them easier to knock out of the arena.</p>

            Also known as Riperian Account Opening, this web application allows for flexible, extensible creation of account opening forms. It's currently being developed for <a href="http://riperian.com/">Riperian</a> entirely by myself, and it uses some external plugins such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://igorescobar.github.io/jQuery-Mask-Plugin/">JQuery Mask Plugin</a>. The form generator allows a user to make a form without needing to know any programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form shown below is a prototype of a bank account opening system. An interactive demo may be available soon.

            Minecraft-Sweeper is a program based on <a href="http://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">Minesweeper</a>. Made with the help of my Senior Project mentor, Ben LeVeque, this project was designed as a precursor to development on my original website. Building this game taught me the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, none of which I was familiar with at the time.

            You can play the game in the window below, or click <a href="http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11830544/minesweeper/program.html">here</a> to play the game in a seperate window. For the best results, use Chrome instead of Firefox or IE.
